          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Imagine theatrical storytelling outside of the theater setting. What does the future of best-in-class storytelling look like?</p>
          <p>This was the challenge I posed to myself.</p>
          <h3>Blue Sky</h3>
          <p>This concept shouldn't hinge on current-state limitations. I wanted to imagine a possible future without worring about technological, market, process, societal or anything else that could restrict it before it ever sees the light of day.</p>
          <h3>Funding</h3>
          <p>Seeing this potential future come to life is the ultimate goal. This concept should be something I could pitch and eventually get funding for.</p>

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>This was a purely creative challenge but I wanted to come away with something that could conceivably be built today and yet still seem like someone stole a time machine.</p>
      <h3>Convergence</h3>
      <p>I needed too look at and understand various technological and non-technological factors that could or are converging.</p>
      <h3>Business Viability</h3>
      <p>In order to eventually get funded I need to keep business viability in mind as the concept matures.</p>
      <h3>Mindful Futurism</h3>
      <p>So often, people imagine a dark future especially when thinking of the impact of technology on society. I need to provide an optimistic look at the future and how it could create a positive influence.</p>

    <!-- execution section -->
    <div class="flex row section content">
  <div class="content">
      <h2>Execution</h2>
      <p>Being purely divergent, generating concepts and documenting the wildest ideas. It's one of the funnest parts of the process. I built up a stockpile of ideas; great, mediocre, and lots of throw-aways. I documented them using any means necessary to capture the idea. Sometimes it was a series of sketches, a sentence or two in a notebook, or a collection of reference URLs with a feature list in Evernote.</p>
      <div class="visual-example">
        <img src="assets/ideation.jpg">
        <span>One of many ideation sketches</span>
      </div>

      <h3>Foresight/Futursim</h3>
      <p>I needed to whittle down the mountain of ideas, if I was going to accomplish the goals of my challenge. I ran through a series scenarios using futurism techniques and analyzed general trends to decide on the direction I wanted to take.</p>

      <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
      <p>Communicating an experience is challenging, especially one in medium that has never been used by your audience. I could have written a novella explaining it all. Instead I storyboarded the major portions of the experience. They provided the most effective means of communicating the concept. The storyboards conveyed the various stories of the experience and simultaneously showcased its major features.</p>

        <img src="assets/storyboard.png">

  <div class="content">
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>By the end, I had a series of documents that visually communicates a new theatrical storytelling experience. It's immersive, utilizing augmented reality as the medium for theatrical storytelling. It combined natural user actions with non-linear storytelling to create a unique experience for each person. Incorporating the spirit of geocaching and simultaneous multi-user input, people explore their physical world and share experiences with others.</p>
      <p>The concept was received very well after an initial round of pitching. Mulitple patent submission have been the primary outcome of this exercise. One day it may come to life.</p>

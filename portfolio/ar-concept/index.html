          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Imagine theatrical storytelling outside of the theater setting. What does the future of best-in-class storytelling look like?</p>
          <p>This was a challenge I posed to myself in 2016 while working at Disney Studios. Multiple emerging technologies were noticably close to crossing the chasm. My goal was to create a high level concept using emerging tech and show how it could drive experiences, innovation and business.</p>
          <h3>Blue Sky</h3>
          <p>This concept shouldn't hinge on current-state limitations. I wanted to showcase a future without worring about the existing restrictions of technology, market, process, budget or resources before it ever sees the light of day.</p>
          <h3>Funding</h3>
          <p>Seeing this concept come to life is the ultimate goal. It should be something I could pitch and eventually get funding for.</p>
        </div>

    <!-- strategy section -->

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>This was a purely creative challenge but I wanted to come away with something that could be built today and still seem like someone stole a time machine.</p>
      <h3>Convergence</h3>
      <p>A major component of the challenge is emerging technology. I need to look at tech and practices that were emerging or converging. Then understand how they could be used as a medium or a driver for an ultimate experience vision.</p>
      <h3>Business Viability</h3>
      <p>To get funded I needed to keep business viability in mind as the concept matures. Something really far-flung was likely to catch eyes but not open wallets. A high concept with an achievable execution plan was more likely to succeed but also more difficult.</p>
      <h3>Mindful Futurism</h3>
      <p>People often imagine a dark future when thinking of the impact of technology on society; Black Mirror, Blade Runner or WALL-E are solid examples of this. I needed to provide an optimistic look at the future and how this concept could create a positive influence.</p>

    <!-- execution section -->
    <div class="flex row section content">
  <div class="content">
      <h2>Execution</h2>
      <p>I spent the majority of my time being divergent, generating and documenting the wildest ideas. It's one of the funnest parts of the process. I built up a stockpile of ideas; great, mediocre, and lots of throw-aways. I documented them using any means necessary. Sometimes it was a series of sketches, a sentence or two in a notebook, or a list of reference URLs.</p>
      <div class="visual-example">
        <img src="assets/ideation.jpg">
        <span>One of many ideation sketches, this one illustrating someone visiting different areas of a city to follow an unfolding story</span>
      </div>

      <h3>Foresight/Futursim</h3>
      <p>Once I had a mountain of ideas it was time to converge and whittle them down. I ran through a series scenarios using futurism techniques and analyzed general trends to decide on the technologies I wanted to focus on and the experience I wanted to create.</p>

      <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
      <p>Communicating an experience is challenging when it's in a medium your audience has never experienced. I could have written a novella explaining it all. Instead, I storyboarded the key selling points of the experience. They provided the most effective means of communication, especially to an audience of film studio executives. They simultaneously conveyed both the major features of the experience and the emerging technologies driving it.</p>

        <img src="assets/storyboard.png">

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>By the end, I had a series of documents that visually communicated a new theatrical storytelling experience. It's immersive and communal, utilizing augmented reality in public spaces. It combined natural user actions with non-linear storytelling to create a unique experience for each person while maintaining an overall, cohesive story. Incorporating the spirit of geocaching and simultaneous multi-user input (e.g., multi-player), people communally explore their physical world and share their experiences with each other.</p>
      <p>The concept was well received during an initial round of pitching. I submitted mulitple patents derived from this challenge, which have so far been the primary outcome. Perhaps one day we'll see this come to life or incorporated into experiences that haven't yet been released.</p>

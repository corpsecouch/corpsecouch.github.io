## What Does It Mean to "Lead from Any Seat"?

My cynical self always thought this phrase was just a platitude executives use to motivate people to work harder or sugarcoat unpopular decisions. Maybe you've felt the same.

Having worked in engineering, product, and design for nearly 20 years—many of those in leadership positions—I've been both the sender and the receiver of that phrase. And there’s a lot that "leading from any seat" doesn’t say.

## What Is Leadership, Really?

Graduation speeches love to throw out optimistic truisms like "you're the leaders of the next generation." But what does it actually mean to lead? How does someone become a leader?

### Leadership vs. Management

In the business world, leadership is often equated with management. Managers, directors, VPs—these are traditional leadership positions. They provide structure, oversee performance, and keep things moving. But being in a leadership _position_ doesn’t necessarily make someone a _leader_.

I've reported to people who were great managers but terrible leaders, terrible managers but great leaders, bad at both, and a rare few who excelled at both. Every permutation exists.

A more accurate way to define leadership is _showing others the way forward_. Leaders don’t just hold authority; they create momentum and inspire action. This is what those graduation speeches are actually referring to.

## The Hallmarks of a Leader

### 1. People Follow Leaders

Leaders don’t operate in isolation. Managers rely on authority to get things done, but true leaders inspire and influence. If people _want_ to follow you—not because they _have_ to—you’re leading.

### 2. Leaders "Bring the Weather"

A phrase I picked up at Rocket Companies, "bringing the weather" means setting the tone for those around you. Your presence changes the environment, attitudes, and overall vibe. Whether that impact is positive or negative is up to you.

What you say—and how you say it—affects others. Even more so, how you _feel_ influences those around you. If you’re energized and optimistic, that’s contagious. If you’re stressed and overwhelmed, that spreads too. This is why self-care isn’t just a personal need—it’s a leadership responsibility.

### 3. Leaders Take Action

Leaders don’t wait for things to happen to them. They anticipate challenges, navigate obstacles, and drive toward milestones. They aren’t passive; they make moves before the situation demands it.

## How to Lead from Any Seat

There are endless resources to develop leadership skills—books, courses, workshops, mentors. But before diving in, the first step is recognizing what leadership truly is. From there, you can explore, learn, practice, and refine your own style.

Of the three hallmarks above, these fundamental skills are crucial to develop:

1. Looking Ahead
2. Communication
3. Self-Awareness

### Looking Ahead

Shifting focus from immediate tasks to the bigger picture takes practice. A great starting point is analyzing a product roadmap:

- What are the goals?
- What problems are being solved?
- Why are priorities set this way?
- What gaps or challenges exist?
- Are there unanswered questions?

Practicing this builds the muscle of gathering information, understanding context, and making connections—all critical for forward-thinking leadership.

### Leveling Up Communication

Communication is the most important skill in _any_ profession, but for leaders, it’s non-negotiable. The good news? You practice it every day. Whether you’re an extrovert or an introvert (like me), improving how you articulate ideas, provide feedback, and inspire action is a lifelong effort worth investing in.

### Building Self-Awareness

Confidence, emotional intelligence, and resilience separate great leaders from the rest. Knowing your strengths, weaknesses, and emotional triggers allows you to lead with authenticity. More importantly, managing stress and recharging when needed ensures you can consistently "bring the weather" you want to create.

## Conclusion

Leadership isn’t about titles. It’s about influence, action, and presence. You don’t need permission to lead—you can start wherever you are. Whether by setting the tone, thinking ahead, or communicating effectively, you can drive change from any seat.

The best leaders aren’t waiting for authority. They’re already leading.

This is the very first time I've shared my favorites from the past year. And, yes, it's almost the end of January but better late than never.

Not every pick is from 2024, a few are from 2023 (gasp). However, everything I've listed is something I either read, watched, or listened to for the first time in 2024. So, it still counts. 

They're in no specific order, instead each pick stuck with me long afterwards.

Enjoy!

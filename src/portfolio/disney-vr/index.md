<!-- ## Challenge
The challenge was to educate and inspire A-list filmmakers and studio executives on the potential of VR and how it could be used to tell theatrical-level stories.

## Process
VR reached an inflection point &mdash; the tech was just entering the consumer space and it was mature enough that filmmakers started to consider it a serious storytelling medium.

Disney Studios has been a filmmaking innovator for nearly a centry. I worked closely with filmmakers, studio executives, engineers, and my design team to keep Disney at the forefront of theatrical storytelling innovation.

## Outcome
We delivered groundbreaking, multi-platform VR experiences that showcased VR's potential for theatrical-level filmmaking and storytelling along with an end-to-end product experience spanning physical, mobile, web, and of course, VR.

We also hosted a VR conference on the Disney Studio Lot where we showcased our VR experiences along with VR from other major film studios.

## Role
I owned the experience design, leading the cross-functional R&D team and managing a team of senior designers. -->

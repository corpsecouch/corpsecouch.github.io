title: Self-Service IVR Powered By Gen AI
description: When you put an offer on a house, you send an approval letter saying how much you're approved for. You only want your approval letter to say how much your offering even if you've been approved for more. Typically you have to wait for your mortgage banker draft a new letter. I led the desing of an voice-based, gen AI-powered phone service that enables homebuyers to adjust their approval letter 24/7.

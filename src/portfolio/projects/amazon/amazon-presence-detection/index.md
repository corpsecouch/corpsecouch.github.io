title: Alexa Presence Detection
description: When an Echo device knows you're nearby even when you're not talking to it, it can feel magical but also a little weird. It's also really helpful to know if you're near a device when trying to do something sensitive, like banking or shopping. I led the design of how Alexa and Echo devices know when you're near a device and use it as an authentication signal.

The business of Disney Studios depends on custom internal enterprise applications. These applications should look and behave consistently as if they were originally created as a part of the same product suite. With hundreds of these mission critical applications, created by various people across many years, consistency is nonexistent. Efficiency and effectiveness from both business operations and product development both suffer because of this.

## Process
I championed the need for a design system to make the suite of enterprise applications consistent and show measurable improvements with users, business operations and product development.

After gaining leadership buy-in, I formed and led a cross-functional steering committee that maintained the overall vision and identified the product, technical, experience, and operational requirements.

## Outcome
We launched a full design system for Disney Studioâ€™s entire suite of proprietary enterprise tools. It included guidelines, design resources, patterns and an Angular UI framework so designers, engineers, and product can all benefit.

Post-launch, it increased the speed of product development, established cross-product consistency, and increased overall user satisfaction with the enterprise products. It was even adopted by other Disney segments including ABC, ESPN, and Disney Interactive.

## Role
I founded and owned and program from concept to launch. Afterwards, I was the stakeholder as it transitioned to a larger team and released subsequent versions.

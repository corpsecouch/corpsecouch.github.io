The challenge was to fix the anitquated enterprise tools the story development team were using to develop and greenlight movie ideas.

## Process
All movies go through a greenlighting process, when it goes into production. Itâ€™s a long and intense where multiple teams gather, critique and develop story ideas and eventually decide whether they are Disney enough. Most stories never make it through. There's a team dedicated to managing the entire process.

I worked closely with the story development team, the users, and studio executives to deeply understand the painpoints and issues plaguing the current process.

## Outcome
We delivered a new movie greenlighting process with a set of custom tools to support it that fully integrated with the overall studio filmmaking process. We reduced the story development lifecycle time and increased the story development efficiency and effectiveness.

This new process coupled with the right tools enabled Disney to scale it's story development across all of it's theatrical segments including Pixar, Lucasfilm, Animation, Touchstone, and Live Action.

## Role
I owned the experience design, leading the cross-functional product team and a team of senior designers.

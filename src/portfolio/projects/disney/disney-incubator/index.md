The product teams responsible for the Studios enterprise tools have tight budgets and timelines. The tools themselves were build using common web technologies. This left the product teams very little room to test or explore risky or unproven ideas, eventually leading to products and engineers that stagnated.

## Process
Working closely with senior leadership and executives, I developed a program that would drive innovation practices across the company in order scale it's business operations, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of it's enterprise tools, provide learning opportunities for stagnated engineering skill sets, and deliver on Walt Disney's founding principles of "doing the impossible".

## Outcome
We launched a program that provides low-risk sandbox for rapidly buidling and testing emerging technology and product ideas.

## Role
I founded and led the program, driving it from concept to launch.

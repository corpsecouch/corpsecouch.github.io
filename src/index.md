## Bio
I'm an executive-level tech innovator with 19 years of professional experience, having worked at Disney, Amazon, and Rocket Companies, and more.

Growing up on a large family farm, I filled my days with immersive storytelling playing RPGs and running D&D campaigns. Once I was in college, I realized I had a talent for understanding how people expected things to work, which led me to gravitate toward HCI.

After spending a few years as an engineering lead I made the switch to experience design. I found a real talent for invention and innovation combining my technical background with the focus on the human experience. As a result I've been elected to innovation councils, received patents and awards, launched innovation programs, and worked directly with C-suite executives at Fortune 500 companies on strategic projects.


At some point I became a musician, playing spacey guitar riffs in The Answer Team. We were based out of Omaha, Nebraska and, when we were active, we toured and recorded two albums. You can check out The Answer Team's music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3mMaoKi4PaOLhYFdAknELD?si=mci-mk0ASMiM1bro9ey0NA).

I currently live in Atlanta with my partner, [Kt McBratney](https://www.ktmcbratney.com/), and kiddo.
